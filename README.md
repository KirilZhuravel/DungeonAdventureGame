⚔️ Dungeon Adventure Game
A classic console-based RPG (Role-Playing Game) developed in Java. Navigate through dangerous dungeons, engage in turn-based combat, and build the ultimate hero.


📝 Overview
This project is a text-based adventure that focuses on the core mechanics of RPGs: exploration, strategy, and character progression. It serves as an excellent demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism within a game loop.

Key Features
Hero Selection: Choose from different character classes, each with unique stats and abilities.

Turn-Based Combat: Tactical battle system where timing and resource management matter.

Leveling System: Gain experience points (XP) from defeated foes to increase your attributes.

Dynamic Encounters: Encounter various monsters with scaling difficulty.

Inventory Management: Use items and potions to survive longer in the depths.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Java (JDK 8 or higher)

Architecture: Clean OOP design

Interface: CLI (Command Line Interface)



🎮 How to Play
Start the Game: Launch the application and enter your character's name.

Choose a Class: Pick a class that suits your playstyle (e.g., Warrior, Mage, or Rogue).

Explore: Move through dungeon rooms and interact with what you find.

Fight: Use the on-screen prompts to attack, defend, or use items during combat.
